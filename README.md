# ESOP Wintersemester 2016/17
Demo and tutorial code for the programming course at Klagenfurt University

## Organization
You will find the source code organized in packages at.aau.esop16.course<XX>, whereas <XX> gives the running lecture number. Note, that files most likely have a history, which means that in the course a way was tried, then edited, then edited again, etc. I try to conserve them with commits, so take a look at the *history* of the files. 

## How to use
The most basic use is to use the button to the lower right *Download ZIP*. You can then use any editor or IDE to open the files. Another way is to simply clone them from the repository. There is extensive help on that for command line and Github Desktop at https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/. However, you can download git from http://git-scm.com/, tell the IDEA IDE where to find it and use from within the IDE. *Pulling* allows to update your local copy at any time. If you find an error in my code, don't hesitate to *fork* the repository, *fix* the bug and send me a *pull request* to add your bugfix. 

Github has an extensive help database, so you might find a lot of answers there. There's also a lot of information out there on how to use git, so just dare to Google for answers.
